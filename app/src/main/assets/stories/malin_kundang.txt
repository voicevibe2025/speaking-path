Long ago, in a small fishing village on the coast of West Sumatra, lived a poor widow and her only son, Malin Kundang. Her husband had gone to sea years before and never returned, so Malin grew up with only his mother’s love and care.

As he grew older, Malin became a diligent and clever young man. Every morning, he helped his mother sell fish at the market. Yet deep inside, Malin dreamed of becoming a rich man — he wanted to lift his mother out of poverty and give her a better life.

One day, a large merchant ship anchored near their village. The ship belonged to a wealthy trader who was looking for new crew members. Seeing this as his chance, Malin begged his mother to let him go and work on the ship.
“Mother, please let me go. If I become successful, I’ll come back and make you happy.”
With a heavy heart, his mother agreed and said softly,
“Go then, my son. But never forget your mother or where you come from.”

Years passed. Malin never returned. His mother waited every day by the beach, hoping to see her son again. Until one bright morning, a grand ship arrived at the shore. From it stepped a handsome man dressed in fine clothes, holding the hand of a beautiful woman. The villagers whispered, “That’s Malin Kundang! The poor boy who went to sea — he’s rich now!”

Overjoyed, Malin’s mother rushed toward him and cried,
“Malin, my son! You’ve finally come home!”

But Malin was ashamed of his poor mother’s ragged clothes. He denied her in front of everyone.
“This old woman is not my mother!” he shouted angrily.
His mother froze in disbelief.
“Malin… I am your mother. Don’t you remember me?” she pleaded.

Still, Malin pushed her away. His heart was blinded by pride and wealth. His mother’s heart broke. Trembling, she lifted her hands to the sky and prayed,
“Oh God, if he truly is my son, let him be punished for his cruelty!”

Soon after, dark clouds gathered. A violent storm struck the sea. Thunder roared and lightning flashed. Malin’s magnificent ship was shattered by the waves. When the storm finally ended, the villagers found a large rock on the beach — shaped like a man kneeling, his face turned toward the shore.

People believed it was Malin Kundang, turned to stone for disobeying and shaming his mother.

Since then, the story of Malin Kundang has been told across generations, reminding everyone that wealth and success mean nothing if we forget our parents and our roots.
