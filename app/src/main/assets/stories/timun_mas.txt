Timun Mas

(The golden cucumber)

In a quiet Javanese village surrounded by green rice fields, lived a lonely widow named Mbok Srini. She was kind-hearted but very lonely. Every day, she prayed to the gods to bless her with a child.

One night, her prayers were heard — but not by the gods. Instead, a giant named Buto Ijo appeared before her.

“I can give you a child,” said the giant, his voice rumbling like thunder.
“But in return, when she turns sixteen, you must give her back to me.”

Desperate to have a child, Mbok Srini agreed.

The giant handed her a seed and said,

“Plant this seed, and you will have what you wish for.”

Mbok Srini planted it carefully in her garden. The next morning, a huge cucumber grew from the vine. When it ripened, she gently cut it open—and inside, to her amazement, lay a beautiful baby girl.

She named the child Timun Mas, meaning Golden Cucumber.

Years passed, and Timun Mas grew into a smart, kind, and beautiful girl. Mbok Srini loved her deeply, but she never forgot her promise to the giant.

When Timun Mas turned sixteen, the ground shook — Buto Ijo came to claim his promise. Terrified, Mbok Srini begged for mercy.

“Please, give me more time,” she cried.

The giant agreed to return in a few days.

That night, Mbok Srini went to see a wise old hermit on the mountain. The hermit gave her four magical items:

Cucumber seeds,

Needles,

Salt, and

Shrimp paste (terasi).

“Use these to protect yourself,” said the hermit. “Throw them one by one when the giant chases you.”

When Buto Ijo returned, Timun Mas ran for her life. The giant roared and chased after her through forests and fields.

She threw the cucumber seeds — instantly, a thick jungle of cucumber vines grew behind her, slowing the giant. But he tore through them.

Then she threw the needles — they turned into a forest of sharp bamboo, piercing the giant’s feet. Still, he pushed forward.

Next, she threw the salt — it became a wide sea, forcing Buto Ijo to swim across. But he didn’t give up.

Finally, she threw the shrimp paste — and it turned into a boiling sea of mud. The giant screamed as he sank deeper and deeper until he disappeared forever.

Timun Mas returned safely home, where Mbok Srini hugged her with tears of joy. They lived happily ever after, free from the giant’s curse.
