When the mountains of West Java were still young, there lived a beautiful woman named Dayang Sumbi. She was kind, gentle, and loved to weave cloth. One day, while she was weaving, her thread spool fell to the floor. Feeling too tired to pick it up, she muttered,

“Whoever brings me that spool, I will treat as my own child.”

To her surprise, a dog named Tumang—actually a god in disguise—picked it up for her. Keeping her promise, Dayang Sumbi married Tumang. Together, they had a son named Sangkuriang, though the boy never knew that his father was the dog.

As Sangkuriang grew older, he became a strong and curious young man. One day, while hunting, he went deep into the forest with Tumang. When his mother asked him to bring home a deer, Sangkuriang searched everywhere but found nothing. Tired and angry, he decided to kill Tumang instead, thinking it would please his mother.

When Sangkuriang returned home and told his mother what he had done, Dayang Sumbi was shocked. She struck him on the head with a ladle and banished him from the house. Sangkuriang left the village, hurt and confused.

Years passed. Dayang Sumbi prayed every day for forgiveness and was granted eternal youth by the gods. She remained young and beautiful, her face unchanged by time.

One day, Sangkuriang—now a grown man—returned to his homeland. He met a beautiful woman by the river and instantly fell in love. Neither of them knew they were mother and son.

Sangkuriang asked for her hand in marriage, and Dayang Sumbi agreed at first. But when she noticed a familiar scar on his head—the mark she had made long ago—she realized the terrible truth. Horrified, she tried to stop the wedding by giving him an impossible challenge.

“If you truly wish to marry me,” she said, “you must build a great lake and a large boat before the sun rises tomorrow.”

Sangkuriang accepted and worked all night with the help of spirits and demons. He built a dam across the river to make a lake and was almost finished when Dayang Sumbi saw the work nearly done. In panic, she waved a piece of cloth into the air, making it look like dawn was coming. The roosters crowed, and the spirits vanished before the task was complete.

Realizing he had been tricked, Sangkuriang grew furious. He kicked the unfinished boat with all his strength. The boat flipped upside down and turned into a mountain, which today is known as Mount Tangkuban Perahu, meaning “The Upside-Down Boat.”
