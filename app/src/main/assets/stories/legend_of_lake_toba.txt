The Legend of Lake Toba

High in the cool hills of North Sumatra, there lived a humble fisherman named Toba. Every day, he went down to the river to catch fish. He lived alone in a small hut and worked hard to survive.

One day, while fishing, Toba caught something he had never seen before — a beautiful golden fish. As he took it out of the water, it suddenly spoke!

“Please, kind fisherman,” said the fish, “let me go. I am not an ordinary fish. I was once a cursed princess.”

Toba was shocked. But before he could respond, the fish transformed into a beautiful woman.

The woman smiled and said,

“I will become your wife, but you must promise never to tell anyone that I was once a fish.”

Toba agreed happily, and soon they were married. They lived peacefully and were blessed with a son named Samosir.

Samosir grew up strong but lazy and mischievous. He loved eating and often helped himself to food before his father came home.

One day, Toba went fishing and told Samosir to bring him lunch by the river. The boy took his time, playing along the way. By the time he arrived, his father was already starving.

When Toba opened the basket, he found only a little rice left — Samosir had eaten most of it.

Angry and disappointed, Toba shouted,

“You greedy boy! You’re just like your mother — a fish!”

The moment he said those words, Samosir dropped the basket and ran home crying. When he told his mother what his father had said, she turned pale.

“He broke his promise,” she whispered sadly.

She ran outside and called upon the heavens. The sky darkened, thunder roared, and heavy rain began to fall.

The house shook as the ground split open. Water poured out, flooding the valley. The flood grew and grew until it formed a vast lake, which swallowed the entire village.

Toba was never seen again. In the middle of the lake, an island rose — Samosir Island, named after their son.

And that is how Lake Toba (Danau Toba) came to be — born from love, anger, and a broken promise.
