Roro Jonggrang

(The Legend of Prambanan Temple)

Long ago, there was a powerful kingdom in Central Java named Prambanan. It was ruled by King Boko, a giant who was feared by everyone. Nearby, there was another kingdom called Pengging, ruled by a wise and brave prince named Bandung Bondowoso.

One day, the two kingdoms went to war. Bandung Bondowoso and his soldiers fought fiercely, and after a long battle, King Boko was defeated. The giant king was killed, and his kingdom fell under Bandung Bondowoso’s rule.

When Bandung entered the royal palace, he met Roro Jonggrang, King Boko’s daughter. She was so beautiful that he immediately fell in love and said,

“Princess, you are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. Please, be my wife.”

But Roro Jonggrang hated him for destroying her kingdom and killing her father. Still, she was afraid to refuse directly, so she tried to trick him.

“I will marry you,” she said sweetly, “but only if you can build one thousand temples in a single night before the rooster crows.”

Bandung Bondowoso smiled confidently.

“If that is your wish, I will do it.”

That night, he meditated and called upon spirits and demons to help him. The dark creatures worked quickly — digging, carving stones, and placing statues at an incredible speed. By midnight, hundreds of temples were already completed.

Roro Jonggrang watched in fear. She didn’t expect him to succeed. When there were already 999 temples, she panicked and called her maidens.

“Quick! Beat the rice mortars, scatter flowers, and light a fire in the east!”

The roosters, fooled by the light, crowed loudly, thinking dawn had come.

Hearing the sound, the demons fled — the night was over, and Bandung Bondowoso couldn’t finish the last temple.

When he discovered her trick, Bandung Bondowoso was furious.

“Roro Jonggrang, you have deceived me!” he shouted.
“Then, you shall be the final temple — the one-thousandth!”

He pointed his hand toward her, and with his powerful magic, Roro Jonggrang turned into stone.

That statue still stands in Prambanan Temple, known as the image of Dewi Durga, the beautiful goddess who was once Princess Roro Jonggrang.
